# TernaryPlotter

TernaryPlotter is a cross-platform, open-source application that I developed with Dr. Glenn Kroeger of the Geoscience department of Trinity University for my undergraduate research over the summer of 2017. TernaryPlotter was conceived to be an easy to use interface for students, researchers, and scientists to plot data to a ternary diagram.

TernaryPlotter is currently in the alpha stage of development.
